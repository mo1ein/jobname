این مصاحبه بعد از گرفتن آفر از جای دیگری بود و جنبه‌ی جاست فور فان داشت. گر چه به عنوان کارآموز، به نظرم نباید ریجکت می‌شد اما مهم هم نبود. بیشتر روی OOP فوکوس شده بود تا چیزهای دیگر. سوال‌های زرد و لوس از قبیل یه جمله بساز که سه تا کلمه بی‌ربط توش باشه هم رنک رو پایین میاره. در کل می‌شد که بهتر باشه. نمره ۶ برای این مصاحبه، نمره مناسبیه.
