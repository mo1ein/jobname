فرایند هماهنگی خوب بود. مصاحبه‌کننده خیلی حرفه‌ای و همینطور صمیمانه رفتار کرد و فرهنگ شرکتو توضیح داد و از نظر من خیلی مناسب بود رفتار و جو مصاحبه. میتینگ روی مایکروسافت تیمز بود که چون نسخهٔ لینوکسی نداره با وب وصل شدم و کمی به سختی لود شد. در مجموع جواب‌های منم بد نبودن و خودم راضیم. قطعاً ریجکت شدن هم پیش میاد به هر شکلی که بگذره چون عدهٔ زیادی مصاحبه می‌شن و شرکت‌های فیت‌ترینشونو انتخاب می‌کنن.
